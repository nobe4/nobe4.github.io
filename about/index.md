Hello, I am Victor (aka nobe4), a french developer, Vim learner, tea drinker, music listener.  

I'm currently a French Engineer in Computer Graphics and Vision candidate at [Efrei](http://www.efrei.fr/). Through this school I was involved in student associations involving [new technologies](http://ice-efrei.fr/) and [student peer helping](http://entraide.assos.efrei.fr/).

I currently work as a web developer in a [french IT startup](http://cogitstudio.com), you can see projets I made with them in the [project](/projects) section. I am interested in Computer Graphics and Security.
