Agnosticism and Atheism are often used interchangeably.

However they mean different things, and ought to be used precisely.

- Atheism: absence of belief

    - Implicit Atheism absence of belief without conscious rejection
    - Explicit Atheism: absence of belief with conscious rejection
    - Negative Atheism: absence of belief without assertion of absence
    - Positive Atheism: absence of belief with possibility of absence
    - Explicit Positive Atheism: absence of belief with assertion of absence

- Agnosticism: absence of knowledge

    - Strong Agnosticism: absence of knowledge with rejection of its attainability
    - Weak Agnosticism: absence of knowledge without rejection of its attainability

E.g.

|         | gnostic                   | agnostic                   |
| ---     | ---                       | ---                        |
| theist  | I know and believe.       | I believe without knowing. |
| atheist | I know without believing. | I don't believe or know.   |

Gnostism is misguided, as unprovable ideas can't be knowable.
