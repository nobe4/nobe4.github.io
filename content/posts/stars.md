Being idealistic is hard for me to brush off. I overly enjoy perfection and the
feeling of having created something _just right_.

Having guidelines, or rules matters only if constituently applied. Code fits
greatly to this via linter, type checkers, formatters, etc.

For other things, I find it useful to have guiding principles, less as strong
rules and more as _unreachable states_. Aiming, if never reaching, for something
**perfectly great**.

Here is a constantly-updated list of guiding stars I have collected.

TBD: write a small paragraph for each.

## It's written, so it exists

## It's tested, so it might work

## It always takes more time

## Comments lie

## Everything decays

## Code create bugs

## Understanding is a muscle

## Comment via types and names

## Geniuses are liabilities

## Completion is illusory

## API is mandatory

## Compose from small

## Prefer the least

## It's never about you

## Speak less, listen more

## Become nonessential

## Feedback over feelings

## ISO 8601

## RFC 1925: 8, 11

## Tenacity isn't correctness

## New isn't good; old isn't good

## Underwhelm rather than overwhelm
