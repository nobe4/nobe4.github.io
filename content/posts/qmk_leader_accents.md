## Espanso

Until very recently, I had been using this [Espanso
configuration](https://github.com/nobe4/dotfiles/blob/e121ff838942e2df5aca50d696f8cca6f5d3afea/espanso/match/accents.yml)
to manage typing accents on a non-accented keyboard.

E.g.

```yaml
matches:
  - trigger: ",er"
    replace: "€"

  - trigger: ",cc"
    replace: "ç"
  - triggers: [",Cc", ",CC"]
    replace: "Ç"

  - trigger: ",ae"
    replace: "æ"
  - triggers: [",Ae", ",AE"]
    replace: "Æ"
```

This worked pretty easily, granted the occasional trigger after a comma without
a following whitespace.

On NixOS, with Wayland, there's unfortunately no way to run Espanso. This
has been a [long-standing issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/328890)
and has only seen limited update recently.

This prompted me to try to bring this basic keyboard functionality into my
keyboard, literally.
