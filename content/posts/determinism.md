## Why did the atom cross the road?

Why did the chicken cross the road? <br>
Its brain caused its muscles to move. <br>
Its neurons caused electrical signals. <br>
Its atoms caused chemical and physical reactions.

The chicken is the combination of many atoms. <br>
It is _literally_ its atoms.

The causality from atom to chicken is _deterministic_: The atom's movement is
responsible for the chicken's movement.

Why did the atom cross the road?

## Does causality have gaps?

If causality has gaps, it means that some effects are not the products of what
came before. They emerged outside of the physical laws.

This is not _unpredictability_. E.g. the weather is unpredictable because of its
complexness, yet it respects atmospheric dynamics and physics.

This is not _unexplainability_. E.g. electricity was not explained a thousand
year ago.

What _fills_ the gap of causality? <br>
It can't be anything that respects the physical laws, so it must be
extraordinary. There has never been a such a record.

It is _possible_ for extraordinary phenomenons to exists, but until their
discovery, the only intellectually sound position is ignorance and humility.
No gaps have been observed: it is then _possible_ that no gap exist.

## Does causality have no gaps?

If causality has no gap, it means that anything is the result of an unbroken
chain of causes and effects.

It does not mean that the past can be fully understood and that future can be
predicted; it doesn't absolve from complexity.

It does not mean that something is in control, or that it has a purpose.
Physical laws exist, but they are not _conscious_ or _intelligent_.

It only means that the physical laws link what was, what is, and what will be.

## Free Will

Free Will is colloquially understood as the ability to make choices.

It supposes that free-willed are not bound by causality, and that they can
make choices regardless of chain of causality.

For example, a free-willed can choose to not eat, even if they are hungry.

Where does this choice come from?

If causality has no gaps, then the choice is a product of physical laws, which
are outside of one's control.

If causality has gaps, then the choice comes from the gap. Anything else is a
product of physical laws, which are outside of one's control.
