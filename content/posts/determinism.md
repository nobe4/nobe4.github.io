## Why did the atom cross the road?

Why did the chicken cross the road? <br>
Its brain caused its muscles to move. <br>
Its neurons caused electrical signals. <br>
Its atoms caused chemical and physical reactions.

The chicken is the combination of many atoms. <br>
It is _literally_ its atoms.

The causality from atom to chicken is _deterministic_: The atom's movement is
responsible for the chicken's movement.

Why did the atom cross the road?

## Does causality have gaps?

If causality has gaps, it means that some effects are not the products of what
came before. They emerged outside of the physical laws.

Gaps are not _unexplainability_: electricity was not explained a thousand year
ago.

Gaps are not _unpredictability_: the weather is unpredictable because of its
complexness, yet it respects known laws of atmospheric dynamics and physics.

What can _fill_ the gaps of causality? <br>
It can't be anything that respects the physical laws, so it must be
extraordinary, like God(s), paranormal, or miracles.

There has never been a record of such a phenomenon.

As far as we know, the world is not extraordinary, it is simply complex.

It is _possible_ for extraordinary phenomenons to exists, but until their
discovery, the only intellectually sound position is not to assume anything
about existence. <br>
No gaps have been observed: it is then _possible_ that no gap exist.

## Does causality have no gap?

If causality has no gap, it means that anything is the result of an unbroken
chain of causes and effects.

It does not mean that the past can be fully understood and that future can be
predicted; it doesn't absolve from complexity.

It does not mean that something is in control, or that it has a purpose.
Physical laws exist, but they are not _conscious_ or _intelligent_.

It only means that the physical laws link what was, what is, and what will be.

For example, if you've not eaten in a while, your body produces ghrelin, which
makes you hungry. This is a product of physical laws, and not of your control.

You can still decide not to eat. Right?

## Free Will?

Free Will is colloquially understood as the ability to make choices, to have
control.

It supposes that free-willed agents are not bound by causality, and that they
can make choices regardless of chain of causality.

For example, you can choose to not eat, even if they are hungry.

Where does this choice come from?

If causality has no gaps, then the choice is a product of physical laws, which
are outside of your control.

If causality has gaps, then the choice comes from the gap. It then comes from
something extraordinary, and is also outside of your control.
