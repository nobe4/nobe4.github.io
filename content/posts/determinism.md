## If causality has gaps

It means that some effects are not the products of what came before. They
emerged outside of the physical laws, in a non-physical space.

Gaps are not _unexplainability_: electricity was not explained a thousand year
ago. Moreover, future research could explain phenomena we don't yet
understand.

Gaps are not _unpredictability_: the weather is unpredictable because of its
complexness, yet it respects known laws of atmospheric dynamics and physics.

Gaps are phenomena that don't respect the physical laws: paranormal, miracles,
gods, etc.

There has been attempts to prove that such gap exist. So far, none have
succeeded; none have demonstrated that non-physical phenomena exist.

It is _possible_ for extraordinary, extra-physical, phenomena to exists, but
until their discovery, the only intellectually sound position is not to assume
their existence. The burden of proof lies on the extraordinary position.

As far as we know, **the extraordinary doesn't exist**. <br>
As far as we know, **causality has no gap**.

## If causality has no gap

It means that everything is the result of an unbroken chain of causes and
effects.

It does not mean that the past can be fully understood and that future can be
predicted; it doesn't absolve from complexity.

It does not mean that _something_ is in control, or that it has a purpose.
Physical laws exist, but they are not _conscious_ or _intelligent_.

It only means that the physical laws link what was, what is, and what will be.

For example, if you've not eaten in a while, your body produces Ghrelin, which
makes you hungry. This is a product of physical laws, and not of your control.

You can still decide not to eat. Right?

## Free will

Free will is colloquially understood as the ability to make choices, to have
control.

It supposes that free-willed agents are not bound by causality, and that they
can make choices regardless of chain of causality.

For example, you can choose to not eat, even if you are hungry. <br>
The choice is a product of physical laws, which are outside of your control.

Free will, much like control, is an illusionary state.
