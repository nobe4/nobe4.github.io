If there's something I like, it's simplicity. If there's something that's not
simple, it's the flags of the world. In this post I try to redesign flags in a
simplified way, using only 4 basic shapes: rectangles, circles,
half-circles, and triangles.

Each flag operates on a 12 ×12 grid, which works surprisingly well for most
flags.

The idea is to create a simpler, more consistent sets of flags. Any symbolic
shapes (e.g. stars, words, etc) are removed. Consistency of shapes is favored
over individuality of each flag, for instance, most circles are only one of 2
sizes.

Click on any to expand, to reveal the name, emoji, and code. Before you do, can
you guess which flags are?
