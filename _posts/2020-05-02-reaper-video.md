# Introduction

This post is as much for me to understand how to edit videos in
[reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) as it is to provide some clear examples of how

This builds on the amazing work of [this
site](https://mespotin.uber.space/Ultraschall/Reaper_API_Video_Documentation.html#)
which expands on the provided video help.
