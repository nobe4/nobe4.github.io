Hi, my name is Victor.

I make stuff with my computer.

## What I do
I mostly develop projects, from small to big, alone or in team, for work or for fun.

You can find out about the projects that I made on the [projects page](/projects).

## My config
* [Vim](https://github.com/nobe4/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
* [Iterm2](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-generalized/blob/master/iterm2/gruvbox-dark.itermcolors)
* [Tmux](https://github.com/nobe4/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf)
* [Zsh & Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/nobe4/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc)
